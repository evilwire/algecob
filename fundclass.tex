\section{Fundamental Class of MGL}

We start with Voevodsky's construction of the collapse
map. We begin by reproducing the purity isomorphism, which
is stated as follows:

\begin{thm}[Homotopy Purity]
Let $i: Z \to X$ be a closed embedding of smooth schemes over a 
local scheme $S$. Let $N_{X,Z} \to Z$ be the normal bundle to 
$i$. Ten there is a canonical isomorphism $\Cat{H}_*(S)$:
\[
X/(X - i(Z)) \equiv \Th_Z(N_{X,Z})
\]
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
\end{proof}
